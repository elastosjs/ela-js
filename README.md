# ela-js - ElastosJS SDK - [www.elastosjs.com](https://www.elastosjs.com)

This SDK allows you to interact with your ElastosJS Smart Contract Databases.

## This is an ALPHA - Proof-of-Concept Version

Expect significant changes between this and the official release.

### Semantics

- we expect `bytes32` to be `Buffers`
- a hex value always has the `0x` prefix
- any crypto functions always return a hex value, we assume you don't need intermediates
